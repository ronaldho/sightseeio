## Dubhacks 2014 Project

Generates automatic itinerary for a one day vacation given the location of the person. Food and activities all included! Includes Android, iOS, and Pebble Watch Version.

## How it works

The user selects the city and the app (either Android or iOS) makes a request to a server which retrieves information about resteraunts, attractions, etc from Yelp. The server responds to the app's request with a JSON file containing the itinerary info. The app parses the JSON to provide a itinrary. The app will connect with the Pebble Watch so that a user can also see and/or receive notifocations pertaining to the itinerary on their watch
