## How it works

The user selects the city. Then the app (either Android or iOS) makes a request to a server which retrieves information about resteraunts, attractions, etc from Yelp. The server responds to the app's request with a JSON file containing the itinerary info. The app parses the JSON to provide a itinerary. The app can also sende notifications to the Pebble Watch (although this feature is not fully implemented).
