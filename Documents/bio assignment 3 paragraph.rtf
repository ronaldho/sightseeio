\f0\fs24 \cf0 Fishery biologists are not negatively impacted by salmon farming. Their job is to monitor the conditions and environment that farmed salmon live in. In addition, they study the cause and effects of escaping salmon, the impact of farmed salmon consumption in humans, and the effects of salmon farms on the surrounding body of water. Biologists have discovered that farmed salmon have negatively impacted the environment. The salmon farms pollute slow-moving waters with sulfides and other chemicals. Furthermore, the lack of any action taken against escaped salmon allows many of the fish to breed with wild salmon, leading to a loss of biodiversity. Finally, the penned salmon are fattened for human consumption, and as a result of bioaccumulation, their are high levels of antibiotics, pesticides, other toxins, and food colouring in the fish\'92s systems.}
